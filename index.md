                  The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we pulled data from
                  the OpenWeatherApp API to assemble a dataset of over 500 cities.

                  After assembling the data, MatPlotLib was used to plot various aspects of the weather versus latitude. Factors looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, 
                  wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explainations and descriptions 
                  of any trends and correlations witnessed.
